This obviously also includes proper colored lighting from various emitters. As there is no actual shadowmap the direct light from sun and moon is rather soft, giving the pack its signature overcast outdoor-looks.\n\n## **What features does it offer?**\n* path-traced lighting\n* temporal upscaling (TAAU), at 50% by default\n* dynamic fog\n* screenspace godrays\n* screenspace reflections\n* waving foliage\n* resourcepack specular support (according to labPBR specification)\n\n## **Any Requirements?**\n* Optifine for 1.16 or newer/Iris 1.5.0 or newer\n* GTX 1050/RX 560 or similar/better (has to support OpenGL 4.3)\n  * GTX1660/RX 5600XT or better recommended for 1080p at default settings\n* Windows/Linux\n* **Intel HD 5000 Graphics and older are NOT supported!**\n\n## **External Links:**\n* My Website: [Link](https://rre36.com/soft-voxels)\n* My Discord Server: [Link](https://discord.gg/y5xzQ6H)\n\n[![Become a Patron](https://rre36.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Patreon_ForEmbed.png)](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=19790203)","published":"2023-05-11T11:00:16.203745Z","updated":"2023-06-12T16:40:37.240973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":28008,"followers":90,"categories":["colored-lighting","medium","path-tracing"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","foliage","pbr","reflections","semi-realistic","shadows"],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["oLFtiBXm","IxJIqh4s"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Xl42lc6c/11b7f0a63d2e6801d802ab211b4e05e79e786cf1.png"},"version":{"id":"IxJIqh4s","project_id":"Xl42lc6c","author_id":"C31QaEcI","featured":false,"name":"Soft Voxels Lite v2.0","version_number":"2.0","changelog":"**By downloading you agree to the terms of use as detailed [here](https://rre36.com/copyright-license).**\n\nChangelog on: [Link](https://rre36.com/projects/soft-voxels/soft-voxels-lite-v2-0)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T16:40:38.348259Z","downloads":26482,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e9e9f9d949dba32a0d5b1d61136d2b37bb1b3aa39601e8e05f6b61a1c20549c32f20e2bb0bd7a22f681ad87e5c6d0ef09bb7404bf49e3d46d39878d02790b174","sha1":"6dd428dc08a23b8f61810357fded9fec5d309a8e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Xl42lc6c/versions/IxJIqh4s/SoftVoxelsLite_v2.0.zip","filename":"SoftVoxelsLite_v2.0.zip","primary":true,"size":2132538,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"3IkvFedj","user":{"id":"C31QaEcI","username":"RRe36","name":"RRe36","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15215556?v=4","bio":"Sometimes, if you listen very carefully, you can hear my genius.","created":"2023-04-25T15:45:51.149974Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"SoftVoxelsLite_v2.0.zip"},"mods\\cupboard-fabric-1.20.1-2.0.jar":{"sha512":"8dfc24bfaa20b0d75994abd3f175d9c1d1f827b0da1580680141f070029033605027384f7f57926ec6e57c934894e510ede89888852f2a8cd7a54db5f9a57f36","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"cupboard","description":"","authors":["Someaddon"],"version":"1.20.1-2.0","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"cupboard-fabric-1.20.1-2.0.jar"},"mods\\lambdynamiclights-2.3.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"4870953196e22d02844b76fdcae29823922401a5b238d134374308a256a7ffcfb9f087369fc0ec23b5cb218b995d2efa6f60ac0b99fbf9b298ee7ffbb4f6937a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yBW8D80W","slug":"lambdynamiclights","project_type":"mod","team":"BEQmFKFk","title":"LambDynamicLights","description":"A dynamic lights mod for Fabric.","body":"# LambDynamicLights\n\n\n[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/LICENSE)\n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n[![Mod loader: Fabric]][fabric] \n\nA dynamic lights mod for Quilt and Fabric.\n\n## 📖 What's this mod?\n\nIt's dark outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire!

Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":247051,"followers":658,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"r6uVoUxU","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20

screen is accessible via the mod-list (requires Mod Menu on fabric).\n- Q: Does this mod work on servers?\n  A: No, this mod is purely visual and fully clientside, so it doesn't have to be installed

You will need to wait for Sodium 0.5.2 to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n**Why does Sodium Extra not work, while <insert other mods that can also disable fog> work fine?** This is because we aim to avoid compromising performance by setting the fog distance to very far distances just to simulate the absence of fog. Instead, we prefer to set the fog opacity to `0`. However, this feature is currently broken in Sodium version `0.5.1` and has been fixed in their development branch. Attempting to set the fog distance to extensive ranges triggers a bug in Sodium, leading to significant performance drops, especially above the world height. \r\n\r\n**It is important for users to read this information and refrain from immediately attributing any fog disable issues to us, which might lead to unnecessary reports on our issue tracker.**\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/compare/mc1.20.1-0.5.0...mc1.20.1-0.5.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-14T08:47:52.386754Z","downloads":140509,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"74b6dce1ede645ffdecf1185fa05701cef68840d","sha512":"f22f22df15c494a428a8113739267ded3a7e2732158a8e948c115e278d9ffcfb9a94faa7ba3a37364318c895d9d43271ecc58a483b8e49e030394c60a5325c25"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PtjYWJkn/versions/80a0J5Cn/sodium-extra-0.5.1%2Bmc1.20.1-build.112.jar","filename":"sodium-extra-0.5.1+mc1.20.1-build.112.jar","primary":true,"size":365533,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"bc9a206b4a38056c0b16c5a653021b7690285c53","sha512":"15a94f7d8e5407381ba9bcff6a41e954ab23c902460483a35ffa93fa1c05e464c0994049165c42f73a07a15b36cb84099542c18d0edc7b4d596ac5d0941487ad"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PtjYWJkn/versions/80a0J5Cn/sodium-extra-0.5.1%2Bmc1.20.1-build.112-sources.jar","filename":"sodium-extra-0.5.1+mc1.20.1-build.112-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":256858,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Bh37bMuy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"YL57xq9U","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EfhDgRdO","user":{"id":"QXAY01zS","username":"FlashyReese","name":"FlashyReese","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30311066?v=4","bio":"Studying Software Engineer at UADY","created":"2020-10-23T09:28:46.803957Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sodium-extra-0.5.1+mc1.20.1-build.112.jar"},"resourcepacks\\Hyper_realistic_sky_[v1.12].zip":{"sha512":"07cee35e74117da344a7a6890c4b4890605337c90fbe307798118374e1f3fec7dbcad16e4507cdae1484ddce2c80231d7b97a81350bd1cb7235d45d24b9bdccd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"PsMUgCo5","slug":"hyper-realistic-sky","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"m7rCHOll","title":"Hyper realistic sky","description":"Realistic skies for your Minecraft worlds.","body":"**<h1>Be sure to check the readme inside the pack!</h1>**\n\nThis pack natively supports both **Optifine** and **FabricSkyBoxes**.

What does it do?\nMCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures(or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.\n\nCustom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.\n\nCIT Resewn does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!\n\nOn top of that, CIT Resewn aims to build upon the concept of CITs by expanding the available types and conditions.\n\n### How is it different than MCPatcher/Optifine's CIT?\nCIT Resewn is intended to be fully backwards compatible with the old Optifine/MCPatcher packs. Though there are some key differences.\n\nFirst, the numeric id system was removed since the Flattening. Packs utilizing the so called \"magic numbers\" instead of the new text ids will not work.\n\nSecond, Optifine and old minecraft versions have a bug which allows resourcepacks to put files in malformatted(or \"broken\") paths.<br>\nThese are paths that contain \"Non (lower cased) a-z, 0-9, dots, underscores and dashes\" characters within either the file name or its parent directories. In the case that you must use such a broken pack, there is a compromise set up which is still highly experimental and not recommended. You can go to CIT Resewn's settings and allow broken paths. (I'm serious, this is not recommended at all)\n\nLastly, to ensure compatibility with foreign packs, CITs will be loaded from .properties files under:\n`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit`\n\n### Does CIT Resewn support Optifine/Sodium?\nWhile CIT Resewn is designed to work without any performance mod needed, I will try my best to ensure it is compatible with Sodium.\n\nWith all that said, there will not be support for Optifine at all.\n\nThere were also discussions around Sodium alternatives such as Canvas.<br>\nMy official statement on compatibility with these mods is \"if it works it works\" unless I say otherwise.\n\n### What about Forge?\nForge is being kinda doodoo recently and Fabric's Mixins is what allows the mod to inject cits into vanilla so smoothly.\n\nDo not ask for a forge port or I'll break your elbows.\n\n### 1.16/other versions?\nSee [Issues#120](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/120)\n\n<strike>If a version says it's for 1.x, it means it is aimed to work on all of 1.x's minor versions but specifically recommended for its listed minor version.</strike><br>\nWell not anymore!

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> _Random Entities: ON (optional)_  \n> _Emissive Textures: ON (optional)_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: With Fresh Animations 1.8, why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) which almost entirely works, and will improve as it's developed further.\n\n----------\n\n[<img src=\"https://imgur.com/BpoAtYQ.png\" alt=\"Donate Button\" width=\"400\"/>](https://ko-fi.com/freshlx) [<img src=\"https://imgur.com/jNCfwOy.png\" alt=\"Discord Button\" width=\"400\"/>](https://discord.gg/Wxs7JEPMrH)\n\n----------\n\n[![Creative Commons License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)  \n](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fcreativecommons.org%252flicenses%252fby-nc-sa%252f4.0%252f) This work is licensed under a  [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).  \n  \n\n-   Feel free to include this resource pack in your mod pack or server.\n-   If you wish to use this pack in any form of content, please credit with a link to the original CurseForge or PMC page where you can.","published":"2022-08-29T01:33:56.443874Z","updated":"2023-07-17T11:16:38.203638Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":26356,"followers":333,"categories":["entities","realistic","vanilla-like"],"additional_categories":["16x","models","themed","tweaks"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["minecraft"],"versions":["s5KTavJK","KQ9bQsZi","O8LeIQn4","E3rgzhGg","WhoErU2P","SaV3drbz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/50dA9Sha/a49a324c9210aaf7f5899199af2eaf6ff345b4ef.png"},"version":{"id":"SaV3drbz","project_id":"50dA9Sha","author_id":"OffNOjBf","featured":false,"name":"FA 1.8.1","version_number":"1.8.1","changelog":"Thank you for over 9 million downloads!\n\n---\n## Base Pack\n\nBuilt for 1.19.4 + OptiFine HD U I3 or newer; issues may occur in older versions.\nhttps://optifine.net/downloads\n\n \n### Changes:\n- Updated Vex model and animations\n- Tweaked Drowned animation for 1.19.4\n- Improved Guardian and Elder Guardian\n- Tweaked Wolf slightly\n- Tweaked Cod slightly\n- Tweaked Salmon slightly\n- Tweaked Tropical Fish slightly\n- Tweaked Villager variation\n- Other various adjustments\n\n \n\n### Fixes:\n- Fixed Vex for 1.19.3 model\n- Fixed Vex model part support\n- Fixed Drowned arms for 1.19.4\n- Fixed Snow Fox eyes texture\n- Fixed Villager hat overlay UV\n- Fixed Villager nose offset when shaking head\n- Fixed Villager 'nope' action when riding or swimming\n- Fixed Horse, Donkey & variants' animation speed when ridden for 1.19.4\n- Fixed Frog walk animation speed for 1.19.4\n- Fixed Dolphin left eyelid and eye position from a distance\n- Mirrored UVs for Spider and Cave Spider legs\n- Other various fixes\n\n \n\n \n\n---\n## Extensions\n\nThe add-on pack has been split into separate 'extension' packs.\n\nFresh Animations Extensions has arrived!

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":241304,"followers":918,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"m0Dd8Cjy","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+ Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.25","version_number":"1.20-2.25-fabric","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T22:37:15.141667Z","downloads":52830,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"21ae6dd81324543e77c10bbb2b928320d71b6750","sha512":"04f017920be9e982c945df0d27ef93a4cace730b7bc6fd46a82c028c50f7d6819ec0a4c28a4454bc681b4591eeddb08b74c330cb577d7a697a2391fcc11d925d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","primary":true,"size":77342,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"a54dee75a5447fe29ab0d1b9f2f6a64c9531337f","sha512":"3bb877f7683b45ff74c5e507aa3c3d263ca3b898eaef58f39c7681cff26cc8a34fbdabb65e9ad46b72c001b2cc8293dc7e02f9f6e26399e008ba4f85833ebebb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65191,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar"},"shaderpacks\\SEUS-Renewed-v1.0.1.zip":{"sha512":"3e924162f174987ac93255146d0d980ebbb86c02df08542fcf2cc5313b5eb312801fbdf965de5af2b4a03f206ec14c62f16fe665e3fb74db115cf3563c03ebff","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"unknown"},"file_name":"SEUS-Renewed-v1.0.1.zip"},"mods\\vmp-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.2.0+beta.7.102-all.jar":{"sha512":"38ba14d870ddbcef233c9baa399005aaccde95d7b77175aa3a795eb9fed1086492b4ac5c6bbc05909dd76dce1b19b5c26613585161c2f3d20f2494beb8b23fe4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"wnEe9KBa","slug":"vmp-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"GFM8VfAH","title":"Very Many Players (Fabric)","description":"A Fabric mod designed to improve server performance at high playercounts.","body":"# Very Many Players\n\nA Fabric mod designed to improve server performance at high playercounts. \n\n**VMP is still in early development and things are expected to break. Please report any issues to our issue tracker.**\n\n## So what is VMP? \nVery Many Players, or VMP for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve general server performance at high playercount \n**without sacrificing vanilla functionality or behavior**.  \nFor the best performance it is recommended to use VMP with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium).\n\n## How VMP achieves its performance improvements?\n\n**Server-side game logic performance improvements:**  \n- Uses area maps to optimize nearby packet sending and player lookups\n- Uses cache to optimize entity trackers, fluid state lookups and ingredient matching\n- Optimizes entity iteration for collisions\n- Optimizes ticket propagator using MCUtil from the Paper project (patch licensed under MIT)\n\n**Client-side game logic performance improvements:**  \n- Makes time source to use built-in Java time source instead of GLFW via JNI calls\n\n**Networking performance & responsiveness improvements:**\n- Uses our own chunk sending mechanism (optionally with packet-level rate-limiting)\n- Adds packet-level per-player render distance\n- Makes vanilla tcp connections more responsive using packet priority from raknetify  \n  (works best when the server is connected **without reverse proxies such as velocity and ssh port forwarding**)\n\n**... and more**\n\n## Support\nOur issue tracker:

Pixels are accurately blended into each other to create a more high-defenition version of the Minecraft textures. The effect can be so subtle as to appear vanilla from a distance.\n\nVanillaXBR utilises image-upscaling algorithms in creating parts of its textures, which ensures that nothing of the vanilla Minecraft look is lost. \n\nSo if you love Vanilla, look no further than this!\n\n#  How was this made?\n\nThis resource pack utilises a [scaling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel-art_scaling_algorithms#2%C3%97SaI) on the textures called 'xBR'. If you've used a retro console emulator before then you may recognise it. \n\nxBR was made by [Hyllian](https://github.com/Hyllian) to upscale pixel art four times its original size. I'd like to give credit to him, as this pack would have not been possible without it. \n\nThe tools I used to utilise the xBR algorithm outside of the emulators it was designed for were scripted versions of [ImageResizer](https://github.com/Hawkynt/2dimagefilter) and [Zenju's xBRZ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/). I then went into [paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net) to edit and combine textures in post. Feel free to make your own xBR Resource Packs by upscaling your own textures! I would love to see what you come up with.\n\n[NEW] Introducing [PackXBR](https://packxbr.f53.dev/)! The easiest way to make your own textures fit with VanillaXBR.\n[![PackXBR promo](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/819040048203956264/1147822916558389338/promo.png)](https://packxbr.f53.dev)\n\n#  Add-ons\n\n##### Special thanks to vanillatweaks.net for inspiration\n[#- Lower Terrain Sides ](http://www.mediafire.com/file/i0d8ryqrd3ihcrl/Lower_terrain_sides.zip/file)  \n[#- Visual Honey ](https://www.mediafire.com/file/gywgq07qafucwbb/Visual_Honey.zip/file)  \n[#- Lower Fire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vczk10euxqw4c0f/Lower_Fire.zip/file)  \n[#- Gui Scale 3x Fix](https://www.mediafire.com/file/46gipz22co9wlk1/3x_UI_Fix.zip/file) (explaination & recommended [text-fixing pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3x-font) from [@obscure](https://modrinth.com/user/Obscure))  \n[#- xBR Clouds](http://www.mediafire.com/file/rjpkzyjyke0ople/xBR_Clouds.zip/file) (fast clouds setting only)  \n\nMissing something you want? Try using [PackXBR](https://packxbr.f53.dev/) to upscale a resource pack designed for vanilla!\n\n# A lazy upscale is a bad upscale. \n\n(disclaimer) While some upscale projects may take a hands-off approach to upscaling, VanillaXBR stands out. I personally assemble these textures by hand, dedicating countless hours of work over the course of three plus years. This level of care and attention guarantees that the textures produced are of the highest possible quality, with no compromises. \n\nUnlike AI-based algorithms, xBR is a meticulously designed scaling algorithm that I hold in high regard and use in a way that respects its capabilities.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LW9JpQL.gif\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" style=\"image-rendering: pixelated;\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uDr4BtS.gif\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" style=\"image-rendering: pixelated;\">\n\n# Links\n\nOriginating from...

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2023-09-23T14:02:42.436211Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1152926,"followers":3846,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Lue6O9z9","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium

It does this by caching all of its content on first launch\n    and on next launch loading back that exact cache. The cache loading is hyper fast and scalable which utilises your\n    entire system. <br/><br/><br/> <strong>Important notes:</strong> <!-- Cache slowdown explanation --> <br/><br/>\n    &bull; The first time your launch DashLoader it will be <strong>significantly slower</strong>. Because it needs to\n    create a cache which contains all the assets minecraft normally loads. This will also happen every time you change a\n    mod/resourcepack if that configuration does not have an existing cache. <!-- Mod compatibility --> <br/><br/> &bull;\n    DashLoader has been known to be incompatible with a lot of mods. DashLoader 3.0 has massively improved compatibility\n    by not forcing mod developers to add explicit support to make their assets cachable. This means that DashLoader will\n    load assets normally for mod assets that cannot be cached. While this improves mod compatibility it hurts speed as\n    the minecraft loading system is quite slow. <!-- Artists --> <br/><br/> &bull; If you use DashLoader for Developing\n    mods or creating resource packs you can press <code>f3 + t</code> to recreate the cache to load your new assets in.\n    If you want to just show off the speed of DashLoader you can press <code>shift + f3 + t</code> <br/><br/><br/>\n    <!-- Community -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/community-new.png\" alt=\"Community\"\n         width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <a href=\"https://discord.gg/VeFTrtCkrb\">\n        <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qbysL1T.png\" alt=\"Discord\" width=\"500\"/>\n    </a>\n    <!-- Sponsors -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/sponsors-new.png\" alt=\"Sponsors\" width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <a href=\"https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/\">YourKit</a>\n    Makes amazing profilers for both Java and .NET.\n    We use their Java Profiler to understand where to optimize further and make DashLoader faster. <br/>\n    <a\n            href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/\">JetBrains\n    </a>\n    Creates excellent IDEs for all programmers and have provided us\n    with access to their enterprise products for use to develop DashLoader and Hyphen.\n    <!-- Donate -->\n    <img\n            src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/donate-new.png\" alt=\"Donate\" width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/> I have a\n    <a\n            href=\"https://ko-fi.com/notequalalpha\">Ko-Fi page\n    </a>\n    if you would like to Support me. <br/> Please only support\n    me if you like what I do, and you are not in a bad financial situation to do so.\n</p>","published":"2021-04-19T09:11:56.149026Z","updated":"2023-08-14T08:07:28.472035Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":444376,"followers":1446,"categories":["library","optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["BV1ALjca","qCSFZJDC","9eCZGA4u","zlSHmaBO","r4TfbmIo","uoZ9GRQf","6XZ8uzBM","8Fdayh7u","OnYC2zew","zCsGOJZc","se6qU2fa","yEJ77Dbe","KBORImrP","vAQbBj1w","HV2NHpfY","k9vsytTC","IbL8S9Tt","CsYSbmtE","Gct6yfbT","h1VgG4ob","Oub3E7JL","8vYUAyOO","fZNzww9k","EqfM9CWW","Y9ZKQAAS","QaDgUeVV","PcGOE5fz","WdNFKue4","3mMWMjAJ","FQY8wtX3","xps3tiEt","nJuq0bM2","OTK7ITDv","JQ7pEK4s","Av1aoyKG","EUniyxEp","uSvjz4bE","HX3WYeGO","bw6BzoC6","fum8FjYI","DsPMHgmj","oDlgxjWQ","bNoZcrPi","XB4YnZ4X","q9pA7KnN","zOVGzQ13","Zt4Hzppp","ctsVVcoF","mswaNhKQ","wDoBtdGY","D6bYfsNQ","VkD2LvlX","BUJc3mxs","xwPC6okA","mcU33FBx","7hqKf7qu","wgtrj8HS"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZfQ3kTvR/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"wgtrj8HS","project_id":"ZfQ3kTvR","author_id":"Y5jbSs5O","featured":false,"name":"5.0.0-beta.2 for 1.20.1","version_number":"5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0","changelog":"# Fixes\n- Fix sodium 0.5 incompatibility\n\n# Internal Changes\n- Switch to vineflower\n- Update loom","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-14T08:07:32.489906Z","downloads":47223,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9aab141121c1e6850621cd8144da6e6c1c2ec80c","sha512":"103ecdb691e12cce0e59c823fbe2961cb5658f3db844b32ee4295073ee1441ca428fa795785360546d9f4ddd320e3a87ab1abf04d2a549e935b018c4e1f2eb35"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZfQ3kTvR/versions/wgtrj8HS/dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2%2B1.20.0.jar","filename":"dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0.jar","primary":true,"size":5819388,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Ea3e9kCo","user":{"id":"Y5jbSs5O","username":"alphaqu","name":"Yan Chubikov","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24830855?v=4","bio":"java ideot","created":"2021-04-16T19:37:28.701722Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0.jar"},"mods\\dynamiccrosshair-compat-3.3+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"0e1e15339cfba4fe2b90af0511ec42d35ec8ea72ce5789bcd9b43c0d2a05aad3102fbd3798645589bf08db6b505be7828bb713128336c2c0aa5af4a015707554","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EwPIWPJ9","slug":"dynamiccrosshaircompat","project_type":"mod","team":"52xZPP3l","title":"Dynamic Crosshair Compat","description":"Mod compatibility for Dynamic Crosshair","body":"This is an add-on to my mod [Dynamic Crosshair](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshair) that adds compatibility for some mods.\n\n**I do not plan to maintain this mod for Forge.**\n\nIf you have requests for mods to be supported, please open an issue on Github!

The mod will show the internal name in that case in the hope you're better at deciphering what's needed than the mod itself. \n\nFor example, the objective of \"The Parrots and the Bats\" is named \"bred\", this will show as bred in the info box. \n\n\nThis is the very first version of the mod, and as such, there are probably still bugs. Please report them!\n\nTo make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft, \nit has been optimized using\n [![JProfiler Logo](https://www.ej-technologies.com/images/product_banners/jprofiler_small.png \"Logo\")](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).","published":"2020-12-10T07:16:17.383874Z","updated":"2023-06-28T12:19:36.792674Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":521120,"followers":930,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-pre5","1.18","1.18.2","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","20w46a","20w49a","20w51a","21w03a","21w05a","21w07a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","21w37a","21w39a","21w40a","22w45a"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["7CcuXvo8","WdvJfoeZ","cG7TokqN","M4TW1uhs","HILGlO18","tAekKEwa","kK2M3xop","6Em9IM5o","KIh7C2jj","UjVVEDzy","46lPmfqC","J2iSDOlC","ehJF8nc8","GMo7T4Xo","KPQY6mZp","irVcytpD","SjmQw2Uq","ktAuncew","X9P1aArG","B7tL3HcK","sVKaNGOr","9kObxiCk","CeaKOPoo","82WU0RPm","VfkzAPDA","Byz7gNoU","LCurb3dX","ULrQ3wMt","VJQWYcDz","u96MLURP","p4psnBkA","FwuDY3z5","HkMtkEM2","FURXdWNB","KeVl7NVo","gfcbMV82"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"gfcbMV82","project_id":"G1epq3jN","author_id":"m44EmA3V","featured":false,"name":"advancementinfo","version_number":"1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-28T12:19:38.294528Z","downloads":117845,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ff10a77f831354f757c1ba4b6906e612549f3ac0dd3b15101dae29a459937bfceabe5e7ce7cd9126e58833a69e5a4ba04993dfcf2098830b9ccf2c192dddc0e5","sha1":"dfa603a2db09d6e303dd2991f016550ae156e3d1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/versions/gfcbMV82/advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar","filename":"advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":43895,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"KfkhaGhb","user":{"id":"m44EmA3V","username":"Giselbaer","name":"Giselbaer","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/243563?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T07:06:18.077639Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar"},"shaderpacks\\Sildur's+Vibrant+Shaders+v1.51+Extreme.zip":{"sha512":"fd724a1ddc0e6386936b15a7fb1797a98cc01cb5a41741fe545ce2a3521ebfa1f018358e6cd8f38594647d9f241021a7ea2de1f77cc7715ded1c916df2bf3f8b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"unknown"},"file_name":"Sildur's+Vibrant+Shaders+v1.51+Extreme.zip"},"mods\\NoChatReports-FABRIC-1.20.1-v2.2.2.jar":{"sha512":"3213e37fc12205e49f69a6c295c8c3237d8464d63dedbfbac4901892752741d22ebf7e1b40d6683143e70ca158fc95b00c2af177a1263038edce9a46b6cbeb79","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qQyHxfxd","slug":"no-chat-reports","project_type":"mod","team":"x70byLOw","title":"No Chat Reports","description":"Makes chat unreportable (where possible)","body":"# No Chat Reports\n\n<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports\"><img alt=\"curseforge\" height=\"28\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/compact/available/curseforge_vector.svg\"></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports\"><img alt=\"modrinth\" height=\"28\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/compact/available/modrinth_vector.svg\"></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports\"><img alt=\"github\" height=\"28\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/compact/available/github_vector.svg\"></a> <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports\"><img alt=\"gitlab\" height=\"28\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/compact/available/gitlab_vector.svg\"></a>\n\nThis mod strips cryptographic signatures that since 1.19 are attached to every message sent in the chat. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

After months in development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait – and we've been busy! Alongside full support for 1.20 (including the latest snapshots!), this pack release also brings a huge slew of changes and quality improvements to existing textures. Sniffers*, camels, cobblestone, GUI – this release's got it all. Many of the changes concern textures that have been in Faithful for an extensively long time and that have become artistically outdated since their first addition. Getting these redone helps the pack maintain a high level of art style consistency and texture quality.

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow.

This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fud5oyF.png))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison above water](https://i.imgur.com/z9HBcvq.png), [comparison below water](https://i.imgur.com/QQMuOTy.png).) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/lYmlmgq.png)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

They occur when the server and client are out of sync; in many cases, this happens when a haste effect wears off and there's some network latency between both. The server tells the client the haste effect is gone, but the client doesn't know about this yet and sends block break events to the server at full speed. The server thinks the client is cheating so it doesn't break the blocks; the client doesn't know that so it thinks the blocks are air now. When the player tries moving into those blocks, the server kicks him back.\n\nI've seen this most often on servers that have MCMMO enabled, when super breaker runs out, but it happens when beacon effects are ending as well.\n\nGenerally, the only way to fix this is relogging, or porting away and back, to unload and re-load the chunks. This mod asks the server to resend all blocks around the player when you type /ghost, within a 4 block radius cube, thus making relogging unneccesary. Or, just press the G key.\n\nThe effect, and the mod in action, can be seen on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHhuU9j4ORo","published":"2020-12-10T07:36:47.850688Z","updated":"2023-06-28T12:22:05.150324Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":473805,"followers":730,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-pre5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","20w51a","21w03a","21w05a","21w07a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","21w37a","21w40a","22w45a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["TkL5hTSN","O2KTnyJK","MBygUmUm","Vqcn6IVm","Cb04hp85","V7J7tuy9","AivV0d0f","Axl3RA4g","tnp2qYSA","3VzGfcy6","bzzRSS8i","os5ciXHO","jkgojWa1","jJm8AVcF","UZnFMo6D","Y57lczDs","2FR9mXIm","9XGArAAo","O9fx4R6S","iTSHNYBP","d5nXweHE","44ZiK4mx","JX1vBTrB","vi6XlYtS","hMLGCA04","yDK0FYVT","m3TU0WFs","iDNuC4km","q7ktD3Pw","Jq5eCzIr","Ec5c8oRK","RzyN0vkk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Jw3Wx1KR/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"RzyN0vkk","project_id":"Jw3Wx1KR","author_id":"m44EmA3V","featured":false,"name":"antighost","version_number":"1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.1.5","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-28T12:22:06.215191Z","downloads":115733,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"202078e8dd3be4a34d09e7008875df296266866b","sha512":"df28a808d5da0549dfca35b1924f8577265d01b15bc4dd53ff8a7a8e2da70c2ad90310db78e3c631fc83826dc2ba5a00651737c8aba979e2c516fd9183497618"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Jw3Wx1KR/versions/RzyN0vkk/antighost-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.1.5.jar","filename":"antighost-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.1.5.jar","primary":true,"size":47162,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oVxXu7Et","user":{"id":"m44EmA3V","username":"Giselbaer","name":"Giselbaer","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/243563?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T07:06:18.077639Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"antighost-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.1.5.jar"},"mods\\modernfix-fabric-5.7.5+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"f84d5d091d309912f259048aa4ff3828f0631d26b228ae34109954667bfb5195ef8600f26524872f2fe0ca394f846880b438429104944be595dbbe6b2ead97bf","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nmDcB62a","slug":"modernfix","project_type":"mod","team":"xw684WUq","title":"ModernFix","description":"All-in-one mod that improves performance, reduces memory usage, and fixes many bugs.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

It was originally intended to serve as Prismarine Shader's successor. Please check the \"images\" section to see some screenshots showcasing the shader's visual style and general look.\n\n \n\nUnique Technologies\n\nSolas is probably the first shaderpack to finally achieve the goal of super fast per-block colored lighting and light bouncing in Minecraft. Both are done with bloom which costs little performance while maintaining good visual appearance.\n\nMost other shaderpacks with 3D volumetric clouds have a problem of them leaking into closed spaces like caves or mountains. Solas fixes that problem by toggling a cloud shadow check in cases when a closed space is detected, thus essentially turning volumetric clouds into volumetric light.\nAnother problem a lot of shaderpacks have is shadow light leaking and peter panning which is not present in Solas.\n\n \n\nKey Features\n\n- 3D volumetric clouds and light rays.\n- Water, atmospheric and border fog.\n- Fast colored lighting and global illumination.\n- Screen Space Path Tracing (disabled by default).\n- Fancy sky effects: aurora borealis, Milky Way, ender nebula, ender vortex and more.\n- Cinematic post effects: bloom, chromatic aberration, depth of field, adjustable and flexible tonemap, TAA, FXAA.\n- Integrated PBR resourcepack with custom emissive and reflective blocks.\n- Advanced lighting model: vanilla & custom ambient occlusion, variable penumbra shadows.\n- Many customizable options with their proper translations to English, Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish languages.","published":"2022-12-13T19:07:08.160319Z","updated":"2023-09-21T17:19:41.003003Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":113791,"followers":344,"categories":["colored-lighting","fantasy","low"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","cartoon","foliage","pbr","reflections","semi-realistic","shadows"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["y4j12BxK","ogGYWNdQ","bNMgAWCx","YZMWbh4h","xHgx5Bvx","WavyjcdU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/f67563148cc454620664faf58208d846ebaef381.png"},"version":{"id":"xHgx5Bvx","project_id":"EpQFjzrQ","author_id":"dilHPVn4","featured":false,"name":"Solas Shader V1.6","version_number":"1.6","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-08T12:00:02.678593Z","downloads":9137,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e08e9062ba1f7e4705b45a2e162f9a52501e7e2b","sha512":"cfc533b162c642b87953a487b083679ebf12f86b008a5e307d0149af796cd03d55188f18322d8ab9b0c164acdf64f0aec8985cf0735e8492984b9ce71d92774c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/versions/xHgx5Bvx/Solas%20V1.6.zip","filename":"Solas V1.6.zip","primary":false,"size":1184526,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"FeXBCccN","user":{"id":"dilHPVn4","username":"septonious","name":"Septonious","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83358692?v=4","bio":"I make shaders","created":"2021-07-23T13:39:53.718189Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Solas V1.6.zip"},"resourcepacks\\Faithful 64x - Beta 9.zip":{"sha512":"a206b477cea63e23ea074c763c3c3c1c1f3c028abb33940be29b63bbb79583837fe81827a23b156427b44d622c2c6875d7d3cef00fab26aa1b163994ade251d5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"r4GILswZ","slug":"faithful-64x","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"WypI4Etz","title":"Faithful 64x","description":"An even more detailed experience with quadruple-resolution textures!","body":"<center>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Branding/main/social%20media/banners/curseforge/f64_banner.png\" /></p>\n<h1>The go-to 64&times; resource pack for Minecraft.</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-addons/faithful-64x-bedrock\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img style=\"height: 63px; width: 1142px;\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Branding/main/social%20media/buttons/bedrock_button.png\" alt=\"Get the Bedrock pack here\" /></span></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Ever since 2010, Faithful's goal has been simple: Provide a higher-resolution version of the default Minecraft textures, while still preserving the vanilla look and feel.

zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n\nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n#### Translators\nLanguages in alphabetical order\n\n- [神枪968](https://github.com/GodGun968) - 简体中文 / Chinese (Simplified)\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - English (United Kingdom)\n- [Madis0](https://github.com/Madis0) - eesti keel / Estonian\n- [co-91](https://github.com/co-91) - 日本語 / Japanese\n- [Rodrigo Appelt](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Português / Portuguese\n- [SyberiaK](https://github.com/SyberiaK) - Русский / Russian\n- [Felix14-v2](https://github.com/Felix14-v2) - Русский / Russian\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (mexicano) / Spanish (Mexico)\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (españa) / Spanish (Spain)\n- [localfossa](https://github.com/localfossa) - Türkçe / Turkish\n- [Im Vietnam](https://github.com/ImVietnam) - Tiếng Việt / Vietnamese\n","published":"2022-01-29T20:52:18.744493Z","updated":"2023-09-28T15:35:33.190866Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":545497,"followers":1459,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["iVw60IvO","cgp0M9ZD","gUBtDUBp","4Kmn0eeU","p4qDdICN","87tTbECt","Z7VJkXXa","2ZC7Fxc8","jfoKe5Fr","HDVevQGA","Dqby42rh","ywAz0NBY","LropUbSI","yRrEHsQ0","qJLT1UZa","t2MUOMy5","IjbCI21q","ClfJLhWu","ssxmDm4w","3bwXGtwH","vdNR7RSe","VqJlUKUp","BrGdvUUq","zS4oS6ht","sC6H3PnU","TQKBOZaT","nls01OIv","f017okM4","YHh8fxDi","p5RjeOJL","mIiMyney","1mKrqlvv","tv8GIQDa","1AYfSJ9O","gZr7EykF","QRQLkNPJ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/25d48c335340c12566044c8f35df5102e72dc06c.png"},"version":{"id":"gZr7EykF","project_id":"w7ThoJFB","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"2.11.2","version_number":"2.11.2","changelog":"- Fix broken Controlify compatibility\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-30T17:55:28.954325Z","downloads":53743,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"75d8785b79cd2333f4d1d326da55ba5fc6372f8d","sha512":"93b15012dab0e43a0ae4c32dc130e12baa4467c4d0a01a130f2a0fd8f8bf7ac5dd8b31660f98fb8124830f6b1e0e6973296251d614e4a85dfff30a5af4267ace"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/versions/gZr7EykF/Zoomify-2.11.2.jar","filename":"Zoomify-2.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":999881,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"VAryyl46","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Zoomify-2.11.2.jar"},"resourcepacks\\SodiumTranslations.zip":{"sha512":"bff528173607b35677e42b46d5b5b1b4d70cc36e466422c38958f2b1ccee5e2b1ad6753a3cc434853efe33b1e56179306ead2d83b3a9331d342d3fe43ba10883","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yfDziwn1","slug":"translations-for-sodium","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"EfuJpDHy","title":"Translations for Sodium","description":"Unofficial translations for the Sodium Minecraft mod","body":"Unofficial translations for the mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium).\n\n## Translating\n\n**By submitting translations, you are agreeing to have them licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license.**\n\nYou can contribute to the translation effort on our Crowdin [project page](https://crowdin.com/project/sodium-fabric)!

It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2023-10-02T18:16:52.181784Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":959281,"followers":2993,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Z9FJWLMt","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-02T18:16:30.272151Z","downloads":1685,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b662fd625ba1f06c6e4958eac373856047d0d2a9","sha512":"2a42ef76cd2a60af01fffed1cd9e08270b537f116f7fa0ede49a5b526fa7b9860845a6f321c4a7600f80e739391eb24a6e6d9850c33894b58bc2d01a8a63f8b4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/Z9FJWLMt/continuity-3.0.0-beta.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1050571,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"peppercode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44146161?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\dynamiccrosshair-7.2+1.20-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"6f5809e4889e5d7380ce60eb9a0e956e69f79b4cd937f26bae108be88479ea18ede2928bc50ae27357e35b5b918bc427f7c589ef80716e8adf46af0d2d23f8e6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZcR9weSm","slug":"dynamiccrosshair","project_type":"mod","team":"Mm7chNKF","title":"Dynamic Crosshair","description":"A mod that hides or changes the crosshair dependent on context","body":"Dynamic Crosshair is a Minecraft mod for the Fabric & Forge launchers.\nIt hides or changes the crosshair dependent on context.\n\n**NOTE: From version 6 on, Cloth-Config has been dropped. Now [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) is needed for an ingame configuration screen, but the mod will work fine without.**\n\n## Features\n* Hide the crosshair when not looking at anything.\n* Hide or show it depending on what is being looked at.\n* Hide or show it depending on the currently equipped item.\n* Change the crosshair style for various situations.\n* Highly configurable.\n\n\n## Dependencies\nThis mod has been written for Minecraft >= 1.18.2.\n\n### Fabric version\n* requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n* versions up to 5.5 require [ClothConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n* from version 6 upwards, there is an optional dependency on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) for the ingame configuration

screen\n\n## Mod Compatibility\nThis mod is very strongly coupled to vanilla Minecraft and has to hardcode a lot of interaction rules.\nThus, playing on a non-vanilla world will make the advanced features (context-dependent style) unreliable.\n\nIf you play with content mods, I recommend also installing [Dynamic Crosshair Compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshaircompat).\n\nIf you like dynamic UI elements, also check out my other mod [Auto HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/autohud) that extends dynamic behaviour to most of the HUD.\n\nDynamicCrosshair is currently not compatible with [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) (set its `enabledGui` setting to false to use its other features).","published":"2022-05-15T15:58:15.616504Z","updated":"2023-09-27T15:39:45.395474Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":164973,"followers":468,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["20bC160n","zJdREVIO","IXij3556","GkGeCML8","Jx2bA8fW","wX0EkxBG","UIPy4N6Y","u6oZjWMI","fwgB6xzq","rbuG9j4d","42x8E1l2","I3ozSAMN","UsI5wvVJ","Ex7R0pvH","bevKbyCT","C9PPMB8n","PUz7ZA69","DnIkKSEu","pKw86PFV","L1X78OCz","piwY5EqP","KdZ4nnQf","KCnkG2JM","vOx5xdxw","8cW3fCjp","OojuYcAm","SoTS6lF5","JZoNSBuy","N8iKshJP","vOMoMaOE","dSEqWeht","6x22u0T1","N3ze65Pu","8npnkOAY","JCXboA43","GwfJ6OPL","Q5W9seuT","MDMciNGY","DOxF1Usr","kVzqYdl5","hBz2RX9S","mqjafYwh","4XF7aDYQ","PDcGuAk3","dB2WXccw","oE6ADLJm","kBkiCSXP","KdRiHgim","Ngbs1lmT","p8mFGtnA","aT7BTmm2","7pIz7Bqe","5Rbzl2ai","HQNnNcTz","rzl6699L","b1MI0lNn","XXp55Fwj","aDXQGAnW","7LySfCZd","jwMWMQBh","3Rj2xiej","UrGLoyuO","jdd7O6I5","3BXMBlz0","Bgo2WQoz","4yNSnLVO","1HKz8pDD","cdWvTN6A","zma0Z88N","EJvo2aYT","SnHjacoX","L3cqS0s1","XxwoXEjt","uuUU7D4O","oGBybcWG","ha2GrJES","qSS7rxZG","kEvLJuWh","nhu2REPZ","AVTfWKih","kgZyjYD0","25UaxOtl","Q7LLoEz8","m758kre1","VlilX4g3","NpJSZyut","KLOwuZTc","siGvzEkG","pnStFlrz","zT12VILM","cR2jSKNv","S5sH62fG","UwrH9Wmp","PYMFga4Y","5ABRCqrl","svCwRMnR","wlHubjbx","me9sUGWp","GaDrUzLS","H2k9LvrK","B8uyNMAs","dHnDtwk3","AF6KCHFM","hW7fVOwD","xMsvqe7U","rOBAdNim","kV3gDaO6","Afi523uo","n7vNnWWX","hUj6v5bw","4ZNImu1V","7POTmnEb","HEyECMZD","BfvDyEpZ","B3fvmlGz","N4UrisV7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZcR9weSm/8da8af58ca961f937bd05d41dcefa26be7b5c182.png"},"version":{"id":"HEyECMZD","project_id":"ZcR9weSm","author_id":"bQuYYbeE","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

shader that can be adapted to anyone's resources. Build the shader you want! All the effects are optional!, and you will only consume the resources that you need.\n\n**¡Compatible with Optifine and Iris!**\n\n## Optional features:\n\n* Shadows\n* Optional volumetric clouds\n* Antialiasing (TAA)\n* Depth of field\n* Enhanced ambient occlusion\n* Water reflection and refraction\n* Motion blur\n* Optional bloom\n* Optional chromatic aberration\n* Auto-exposure\n* Shader for all native dimensions\n* FAST!\n* And more...\n\n## Tested on\n\n* Minecraft 1.12.+ - 1.18.x\n* Nvidia, Intel, AMD (It's not guaranteed to work on each and every existing model)\n* Windows and Linux\n\n## You can\n\n* You can use the shader without restrictions.\n* You can fork the shader from: [https://github.com/javiergcim/MakeUpUltraFast](https://github.com/javiergcim/MakeUpUltraFast)\n* You can modify this shader for any purpose.\n* If you modify or use the shader PLEASE add a credit.\n\n## Color schemes\n\nIt can be boring that everything looks the same all the time. Choose a color scheme according to your tastes and change it whenever you want.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nLeave Optifine's native shader options at their default values, otherwise you may see shader quality reduced. Customize using only the options of the shader itself.\n\nShadows and depth of field are resource-intensive effects. You can remove them if you need more performance, and it will still look great.\n\n## Donation\n\nIf you think this work deserves a small stipend, please donate! I will be eternally grateful to you:\n\n[Donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4N9Q5RMZL2CVN)","published":"2023-01-28T02:06:57.945289Z","updated":"2023-09-07T19:40:17.808809Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":85517,"followers":248,"categories":["potato","semi-realistic","shadows"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","fantasy","foliage","low","medium","reflections"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["giJQJsir","nq7l7BcV","Rml9AYAP","yt7KFLEm","1MLTwdqr","AQ14CMui","qFEY5xhc","HZOCaLH4","UEwFm12B"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/izsIPI7a/837881b08df8ed8a7a43b48484bcbfd62c301142.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"UEwFm12B","project_id":"izsIPI7a","author_id":"VoROpsYm","featured":false,"name":"MakeUp Ultra Fast v8.8f","version_number":"8.8f","changelog":"# Changes\n\n- Configurable night vision tint (thanks to Alex Wauck)\n- The lighting varies depending on the moon phase ((thanks to Alex Wauck)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-07T19:40:18.931503Z","downloads":13782,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"463baaaeed5c54ffa916f5956530c62243922e2f","sha512":"39013eabaa5c0b4802651538625892368f28ffeda0905a78287b59e22e3a061a01f1d6a76b74ccce03393e67388e6d7746445889e00e473ea017b9f18f661940"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/izsIPI7a/versions/UEwFm12B/MakeUp-UltraFast-8.8f.zip","filename":"MakeUp-UltraFast-8.8f.zip","primary":true,"size":337839,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"OY8on704","user":{"id":"VoROpsYm","username":"javiergcim","name":"Javier Garduño","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52302482?v=4","bio":"A simple computer scientist, interested in AI, artificial life, maths, web development, and many, many more.\r\n\r\nRead me in: https://esceptica.net","created":"2023-01-28T02:03:43.256716Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MakeUp-UltraFast-8.8f.zip"},"mods\\Bookshelf-Fabric-1.20.1-20.0.5.jar":{"sha512":"55338c20d925000fef9818c7beb6ecc63c201b2563a7d7d6c3f352f2826805715e59028d1df3292cb9c6811b079d417402284fd643343e9c19a6e3cafd1513f1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uy4Cnpcm","slug":"bookshelf-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"qdYl5sw1","title":"Bookshelf","description":"An open source library for other mods!","body":"<p>Bookshelf is a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-09-23T21:11:09.410835Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2298379,"followers":6384,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium

About\n\nNeat is a mod that adds Unit Frames to the top of every entity, as seen in the image above. You can see info such as name, health, and armor. Yes, the name is a pun on Tidy Plates.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\n- Fully client sided\n- Health bars only show up if the mob is not obstructed\n- Health bar color changes depending on the mob's health % (green to yellow to red)\n- Shows the mob's attribute (for Smite or Bane of Arthropods) and their armor\n- Groups up health bars for mob stacks (like spider of chicken jockeys)\n- Works with minecraft's Scoreboard Teams.

All other websites distributing the mod are not owned/affiliated with me and might publish incorrect or outdated mod files or even worse malware.**\n\n## Current features\n\n* When hovering over items you can scroll up and down to send single items up and down.\n  * When holding _shift_ alongside you may send whole stacks of items.\n  * When holding _control_ alongside you can move all stacks of the same type of item.\n  * When you're in scrollable inventories you might want to press _alt_ to prevent scrolling items.\n* When you're sending items via shift-leftclick you can now hold both buttons to send all stacks you're hovering over\n* Hold alt-leftclick to drop items quickly.\n* When you're in the creative inventory and hover over the tab icons you can scroll through all the creative tabs and pages.\n* In your facourite recipe books you can:\n  * hover over the recipe grid to scroll through the pages.\n  * hover over the recipe group tabs to scroll through them.\n* Sort inventories by clicking with your mouse wheel (you can also define an own keybinding)\n  * sorts by raw id (will most likely group by mods and similar items)\n  * hold _shift_ while clicking to sort by quantity\n  * hold _control_ while clicking to sort by alphabet\n  * You can customize which sort modes you prefer\n* Press the swap key in any inventory to swap with the offhand\n* Let your slots be automagically refilled from your inventory!\n* Pick the matching tools for blocks by either sneaking while picking the block or by holding a tool. (this is configurable)\n* Right-click trades or recipes to directly apply the crafting. When holding shift it will craft/trade a full stack\n* Also: Armor switch if MW is installed on the server-side 🙂\n\n## Configuration\nLots of stuff is configurable. To open the config screen you'll need to install [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu).\n\n## Limitations\nSince this mod is completely clientside item scrolling might be a bit laggy on hard-working servers.\n\n\nThis mod will not work in *Applied Energistics 2* screens and inventories. AE2 handles inventory screens even more strangely than Mojang handles creative inventories, so don't expect any fixes from my side!\n\nTo make you aware of this MW declares a conflict with AE2 which will show up in the log. This incompatibility only applies to certain mods and all other inventories will work fine.\n\n## Before Version 1.3.4\nThere are bugs in Tweed (library used by Mouse Wheelie) and Artifice (library of Extra Pieces) which make these mods incompatible when bundled within other mods.\n\nTo make Mouse Wheelie work with Extra Pieces please install the latest version of Tweed alongside!\n\nWith version 1.3.4 this bug has been fixed in Tweed and my other library mods - so no more incompatibilities from my side.

**[ForgetMeChunk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgetmechunk)**\n- **[ChunkSavingFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-saving-fix)**\n-

[Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/debugify) • [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/debugify) • [Patched bug list](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/blob/1.19/PATCHED.md) • [Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) - Founder of project\n- [**Contributors**](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/graphs/contributors) - For PRing new fixes!\n- [**MoonTidez**](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Creating an awesome logo!\n\n### Translators\n- [**RaptaG**](https://github.com/RaptaG) - Greek\n- [**Altegar**](https://github.com/Altegar) - Ukrainian\n- [**ttrafford7**](https://github.com/ttrafford7) - Ukrainian\n- [**GodGun968**](https://github.com/GodGun968) - Chinese\n- [**Agentew04**](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Portuguese\n- [**localfossa**](https://github.com/localfossa) - Turkish\n- [**xMikux**](https://github.com/xMikux) - Traditional Chinese\n","published":"2022-03-17T20:44:31.607662Z","updated":"2023-09-28T17:16:47.396636Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":520131,"followers":1119,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["d1wGDnOg","rvmKzdit","lFcWshUo","nDA4zR8b","bDJ6C3ee","YToHBCxz","SL7w72eH","phRoW4cz","XcwsnmsZ","1pnb6cGl","fX9fSRpc","D3InZWhh","NR1MuP9t","ez77o4vP","ZSOeDjPU","rlPcRBXm","nElg9xeo","J3zRK5bi","FatqexKs","tWRyPcFL","NDu88Zwa","hY3DKYio","aOxCEP3D","CSWmF24f","pPFCiLjA","BCj6Z3cx","TCs1cNbH","7WXEKPNx","Tk0RAQMD","rKzPCLMb","jlIRKhk7","m21FBC92","XtJaW95T","ltSWiXrH","jxiMbq1j","GeIPOMAw","IWgfkuO9","vgor1UDw","h7UENtbi","BmkonV8u","LVTec1Rh","US297WEJ","7nWg7CpV","2CSuLT5g","4J87zok9","11cqAA0W","1Wc2PZ7G","IhcW4hp4","jl2bfULg","qGM9M0wh","9xvnFOIg","KB2xqwsT","W2UIVXCp","SCJtEeya","HdzIkYvh","pYAlD9TK","UvBWAMZL","l8A2i9nV","fgjgGIfI","GtD9tAHh","v2s5aT84","CQP9o8LS","oevI3RPR","jskCDMsk","l6S5WIlU","7SaNcvDx","6ckEWNPu","GTuKuQLA","6XDJoCks","ZSI78Xd3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QwxR6Gcd/d1db8e74a5ad29908bd011ce271145cea349cd13.png"},"version":{"id":"6XDJoCks","project_id":"QwxR6Gcd","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1+2.0 (1.20.1)","version_number":"1.20.1+2.0","changelog":"[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n\n# Debugify 1.20.1+2.0\n\n## New Fixes\n\n- [MC-263865](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263865) - Fullscreen state isn't saved when F11 is pressed\n- *by [Ampflower](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/pull/259),* [MC-8187](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-8187) - Two-by-two arrangements of jungle or spruce saplings cannot grow when there are adjacent blocks located north or west of the sapling formation\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-09T08:49:42.583816Z","downloads":128048,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ca859180ad2b57856fbcc8db4995c1871a7d556c","sha512":"4cbeeafd7daadcf8a54526b6f415eac39c8bd1459d44967f484c499f407b9625c10faa5c8f825946d97529d5d64fd7504669bc13ebc4c3eb2a143aa20b50e4bd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QwxR6Gcd/versions/6XDJoCks/Debugify-1.20.1%2B2.0.jar","filename":"Debugify-1.20.1+2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":337545,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"CgwTUAR2","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ArPsDJdJ","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Debugify-1.20.1+2.0.jar"},"mods\\iris-mc1.20.1-1.6.9.jar":{"sha512":"9025927e394119ceaf2f106886a401abe95cd32d6afdfb114ceb065d907a437f7f2bc43037e14ff2794c2f14e6d033ffb53a22b01a0677e2e0035337aac1f4c6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YL57xq9U","slug":"iris","project_type":"mod","team":"1HMZl6Mn","title":"Iris Shaders","description":"A modern shaders mod for Minecraft intended to be compatible with existing OptiFine shader packs","body":"![Iris: An open-source shaders mod compatible with OptiFine shaderpacks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IrisShaders/Iris/trunk/docs/banner.png)\n\n## Links\n\n* **Visit [our website](https://irisshaders.dev) for downloads and pretty screenshots!**\n* **Visit [the shaders section](https://modrinth.com/shaders) to find shader packs!**\n* Visit [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu) to chat about the mod and get support!

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods (ImmersivePortals benefits a lot from this)\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

If you are a user, this means this mod does nothing on it's own and you should only install it when using another mod that depends on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Install the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Configured</strong></span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mrcrayfish\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MrCrayfish</strong></span></a> if you want in-game configuration!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This port became necessary as I wasn't able to find an existing config api on Fabric which suited my needs, also I have a bunch of code built on top of Forge's api, so just porting the api was the easiest solution. Any other dev seeking to use the Forge config api on Fabric to maintain their project(s) on both loaders is welcome to use this library. Instructions on how to add Forge Config API Port to your development workspace can be found on the GitHub page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If you're using a multiloader Gradle setup for your workspace, e.g. as demonstrated <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>here</strong></span></a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jared</strong></span></a>, Forge Config API Port is especially useful, as it can be directly added to the common sub project, so that all Forge config features can be used in any sub project, mod loader specific code only being required once when registering configs. It's really neat, believe me!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code>, or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</del></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Default in-game configuration will be added when the related <a href=\"https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/8874\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>PR</strong></span></a> is finalized and merged into Forge. Since the approach the Forge team is taking for configs screens is rather basic, I'm also planning on providing my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for Fabric, to offer in-game configuration in a more user-friendly and feature packed manner.</del></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">More information concerning the licensing of this project and additional information for other developers can be found on the GitHub repo.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>🏆 Credits:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Developing Forge Config API Port was helped and inspired by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The whole Forge team, they really did a great job putting together this config api for Forge.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 36px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzs_/projects\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs_&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=curseforge&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Fuzss\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzss&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l26SuCmCNSCPefpfbCX7Q\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=youtube&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"89\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=@Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=twitter&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"124\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=u/Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=reddit&amp;logoColor=white\" alt=\"Reddit\" width=\"130\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs%200212&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"127\" height=\"28\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>","published":"2021-12-03T10:23:02.288424Z","updated":"2023-09-21T22:19:29.117770Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":328318,"followers":654,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["VpvE1h2H","16w4kT84","3h8hgyqP","AxEvkjh5","notOZAjX","GJ0aBxFN","2eL7Opm5","JpOqHq5p","jwtFMyhT","eYeUbc3T","86FCTo9M","rXgI0k5P","h7joEojU","WjwjuiDp","p2C10JUL","4JaArhTS","XGKEYlsw","K7z34XSj","vlllTHgw","akDg87hC","JdloDJit","KjE2hCJv","XhjJZ5uE","fI5AsaV4","CkM0mGHX","H1LkHOeQ","hRGdglV6","FtpEL8G9","tlNCwMwZ","sJryrwj9","tqRbIeBK","bh0uyJuX","alqrny5V","cjmImt9R","6J0K7FyD","3VCgXZ79","TFLCxTVc","mFoJ8qnh","ou26o2qg","MkqOn4Yc","2TybfFU8","oYUxEUGk","nlcnay8A","1cG1sI8e","ewYccCIi","CtENDTlF","f5d9VI72"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ohNO6lps/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"CtENDTlF","project_id":"ohNO6lps","author_id":"rHdGpxOA","featured":false,"name":"[FABRIC] [1.20.1] ForgeConfigAPIPort-v8.0.0","version_number":"v8.0.0-1.20.1-Fabric","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v7.0.0-1.20] -

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2023-10-03T09:07:54.950827Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":323232,"followers":1016,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/5e127e83e3b55e3cebf32e3e8b355296ea62d87d.png"},"version":{"id":"zO7oFMiv","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 1.0.2","version_number":"1.0.2","changelog":"- fixed a mistake in the block entity code causing unnecessary lag","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-20T06:34:34.178007Z","downloads":15145,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ad69d9bbe51135792a0eb6dd20bdc3736f6f64e82e7fed9fda16bd462734c55b1c8924284727fca61f5b7bf12da8a5f40fc2b4d5566222e1e2942b7a044f0976","sha1":"87147ac0b539ccb0f409a1eaa4914846b513db67"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/versions/zO7oFMiv/entity_model_features_fabric_1.20-1.0.2.jar","filename":"entity_model_features_fabric_1.20-1.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":290514,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BVzZfTc1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fXLgMy6f","user":{"id":"rLbuLV6t","username":"Traben","name":"Traben","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8456487?v=4","bio":"What even is OptiFine?","created":"2022-01-26T01:51:52.290422Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entity_model_features_fabric_1.20-1.0.2.jar"},"mods\\memoryleakfix-fabric-1.17+-1.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"a921d171d4391a690724cde818d43f666b03a36e1ffa05849c2c853f6e005f6fc4254f1bc040890a0a8a6eff57abf2edf73367189bb2ec9e34e9df92920d89ad","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NRjRiSSD","slug":"memoryleakfix","project_type":"mod","team":"PxfoVTFT","title":"Memory Leak Fix","description":"A mod that fixes random memory leaks for both the client and server","body":"# memoryLeakFix\n### A mod that fixes multiple memory leaks in Minecraft.

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not

Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

Unfortunately, Minecraft changed a lot of internals with 1.19.4, and updating isn't just a matter of changing a few things, it'll also mean figuring out a lot about how it works now. I currently don't have the time and energy to do this, so there won't be a 1.19.4 update in the forseeable future. Sorry for that to everybody who uses my mods.\n \n Some mods (which don't use a gui) will still work, but everything that has a settings or configuration screen won't, so you might still see updates to some of my mods.\n \nAs long as you don't use the config screen, the 1.19.3 version of the mod should still work on 1.19.4.\n\n\nThis mod helps you access containers (chests, shulker boxes, barrels, but also hoppers, dispensers, ...) that are marked with a sign or item frame. Right-clicking a sign or item frame that's attached to a container will open the container instead.\n\nUnlike other similar mods, it's purely client side, so it works on any kind of server - vanilla, modded, or spigot/paper.\n\nYou can still rotate items in item frames by sneaking and clicking them.\n\nThe same goes for signs that have some functionality attached by the server, for example, buy/sell signs on a server that has ChestShop or a similar plugin enabled.","published":"2020-12-12T11:44:27.908567Z","updated":"2023-06-30T07:35:08.441643Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":171072,"followers":867,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-pre5","1.18","1.18.2","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","20w49a","20w51a","21w03a","21w05a","21w07a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","21w37a","21w39a","21w40a","22w45a"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["h8bGqEhA","VFVct0Df","RAzzHtvo","wYbG1TyG","nxb14Kj8","TDeFdTIS","8o51G2i7","3htKSYvl","C5dkN3yQ","SL26Gyb3","j1JBpo8z","pUmH0Qp4","jSyFHCqu","sSSxl0Ai","jEUeKqWP","peyOaYw9","ZyygREAD","Anv6Fp5Z","Kbn1lNJL","14C7wPMc","bJf4bGiY","s6eVSN6f","puyruYCG","EZAA7MCl","Dz6XIgB2","YQDVV9kV","Rxkd5QRH","BBRbJ4Fd","ZMcunEOm","17Qfgj2T","APnhH1uF","bwQT3Pqa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z5b0cAlD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"bwQT3Pqa","project_id":"Z5b0cAlD","author_id":"m44EmA3V","featured":false,"name":"clickthrough","version_number":"1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1","changelog":"Fix the error message from modmenu when configuring\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-30T07:35:09.841499Z","downloads":14034,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"af4fab0a71ef09870c724a22036437070fb54952","sha512":"11b75d1cb1c1d220c180e674156a8e67b4c5cb5f8a2664ab1867be38b947efce029924d1cb28394dbde8d5f8bfceeb7d1a34b3449a298383481227490ec33bbd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z5b0cAlD/versions/bwQT3Pqa/clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar","filename":"clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar","primary":true,"size":95682,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Oab6ZkPT","user":{"id":"m44EmA3V","username":"Giselbaer","name":"Giselbaer","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/243563?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T07:06:18.077639Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar"},"mods\\reeses_sodium_options-1.6.5+mc1.20.1-build.95.jar":{"sha512":"8f0e96ebf0d8f114f789b644b8360fce2fc260716af2b69ea352e96f01e0f4f2871ec0eb4b7f279f2b90117e30c55fa851eca3e39353fdebe03bfca7d2962c3a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Bh37bMuy","slug":"reeses-sodium-options","project_type":"mod","team":"MlZUm0f7","title":"Reese's Sodium Options","description":"Alternative Options Menu for Sodium","body":"Replaces Sodium's Options Screen with intention of improving UX\n\n \n\n# Features\n- Search Bar.\n- Slider values can be changed while holding down `SHIFT` key and scrolling.\n- Scrollable Tabs\n- Scrollable Pages (Overall better UX when using with Sodium Extra).\n- Iris Shader Pack Button.\n \n\n# Screenshot\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/KBsXRBI.png)\n\n![image2](https://i.imgur.com/UjVSMcC.png)\n\n\n# Requirements\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)\n\n\n#### Please do not go and ask CaffeineMC to support this.

This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight).\n\n## What does C2ME stand for?\nConcurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.\n\n## So what is C2ME not?\n**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  \nAlthough it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  \nSo backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.\n\n## Support\nOur issue tracker: [link](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues)  \nOur discord server: [link](https://discord.gg/Kdy8NM5HW4)\n\n## Development builds\n**Note: Development builds may modify the config files in a way unreadable by previous versions. You may encounter crashes or config reset when rolling back to previous versions. Please always backup your config.**\n\nYou can find development builds here: https://ci.codemc.io/job/RelativityMC/job/C2ME-fabric  \nNote that these builds may contain more bugfixes and performance improvements but are less tested.  \nIf you have encountered any problems in release builds, give development builds a try before reporting. \n\n## FAQ\n- Q: Does this benefit client as well or only

It reduces on how often parts check rather they need to update(Set this to your monitors refresh rate I'd say, so it checks for example 60 times per second rather the scoreboard changed, and only renders when it's actually different. Before it checked each frame which was too often)\r\n* Update MixinExtras to 0.2.0-rc.2\r\n* Fix hanging sign text rendering a block too low\r\n* Fix config reset button not actually working(just visually)\r\n* Update tablist on heart blink and username style change by @JustAlittleWolf in https://github.com/tr7zw/Exordium/pull/99\r\n* Added a small text to the config screen to remind people that [supporting the dev is an option](https://tr7zw.dev/donate/) 😇\r\n\r\n## Known issues, please don't report/ask:\r\n* Nametag buffering is still broken\r\n* Mod UI elements like minimaps are not buffered(Neither on NeoForged or Fabric)\r\n* The better F3 slide-in animation is bound to the update rate, so it is laggy\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/Exordium/compare/1.1.4-1.20.1...1.2.1-1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-08T11:25:55.835190Z","downloads":10901,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e27a8ea01478c8c8d2d101ae567b6c708da1b6ff932fb1840922c518f2e918dc8182b4e5220d71ea0155063b030cd2f82818a320fce33f2f1eeed6a512641b45","sha1":"4e905da34fca10f2d263c05103966727e127bf32"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DynYZEae/versions/fROHV9gC/exordium-fabric-1.2.1-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"exordium-fabric-1.2.1-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":324389,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"VTZ6EyAv","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"exordium-fabric-1.2.1-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\physics-mod-pro-v160-fabric-1.20.1.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"1feb6b7693eab605f2a0c89d5d5abc01a44c3584b8b62cb5df25c17d0f362145f57169537e4abde814d71ebb225347bdbdc56c0a0c642d56bfc994a6cdbaaf39","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Physics Mod","description":"Welcome to a more destructive Minecraft then you've ever seen before!","authors":["Haubna"],"version":"3.0.8","icon":"C:\\Users\\EDM115\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\aa0a388bc9308dab8de7d8e95df8f04b6e4eaf00.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"physics-mod-pro-v160-fabric-1.20.1.jar.disabled"},"resourcepacks\\VisibleOres2.10-6xBR.zip":{"sha512":"a249eba102cba7094cb145f5d0517c44c910d779fc403c864733cf81b61ffa31ba512decd2a5df6c351ec1d7e3dd92a87190c7b026c137d636bcaf77af19fa2c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":null,"description":null,"authors":[],"version":null,"icon":"C:\\Users\\EDM115\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\4a82d6c3cc58f857d4f5afeeb8497124e5f39809.png","project_type":"resourcepack"},"file_name":"VisibleOres2.10-6xBR.zip"},"mods\\architectury-9.1.12-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"54bdfc469f897e70a10b31c49d908e09b9cdefdda87c662ad6695c713fbf901bc37256c157ca7d2b9c70a13b304ee74a88cbead98bb23f1ae10e2aef3482db17","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lhGA9TYQ","slug":"architectury-api","project_type":"mod","team":"72qgsq9X","title":"Architectury API","description":"An intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.","body":"# Architectury API\n\nTalk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/C2RdJDpRBP)!\n\nAn intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

standards of quality, and top tier optimisation. It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Unbound\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on pushing the boundaries of Minecraft and providing a new experience. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

[Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of.

Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2023-06-26T05:15:03.318589Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":587915,"followers":2204,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i3v1Skck","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.9 for 1.20.1, 1.20","version_number":"0.9+1.20","changelog":"- Update to 1.20(.1)\n- Enhanced decorated pots","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-26T05:15:05.839603Z","downloads":205989,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"61cfe50f69f8ef9e3640c0269ef158870f5b0410","sha512":"7e8b402fd25efd396bc7f0f25a663808ae9890accc227850c454dfcdc975657f22afceb15878e781485622434a6f6d60aff2a60264aa4425edd52ebe052a0de5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/i3v1Skck/enhancedblockentities-0.9%2B1.20.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":490690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"FLGCXPFi","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar"},"mods\\ClearDespawn-fabric-1.20.1-1.1.13.jar":{"sha512":"aa168dc46319af407c7b0082e2364a5b94ef9eda3c8fe48a0bd726e43f9782f10c82a3f066b89e5db8d4c476a2e43f796a6202b211e07dbc2b05d1a123f8b12d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yoJJjRRE","slug":"cleardespawn","project_type":"mod","team":"vTB28D2M","title":"ClearDespawn","description":"Make items blink when they're about to despawn","body":"Clear Despawn is a mod that makes dropped items flash when they're about to despawn.

I tested this with many other mods, and they now seemed to work. If you get any further crashes or issues, feel free to report them.\n\nAlso I am still working on porting to 1.20.2. Given the amount of changes that were made to the game internally in 1.20.2, it may take a long time, again.\n\n## v3.0 changelog\nThe version v3.0 is finally ready, and features a lot of changes.\n\n### First, some important things to note:\n- I wanted to write this mod to be fully independent from Fabric API and Architectury API. As such, this mod does not have any code that depends on those. However, due to a \"bug\" in how the Fabric Loader behaves, not installing Fabric API will result in crashes taking place anyways, so I guess that effort was in vain. In other words, this mod sort of depends on Fabric API, but not because it wants to, and is instead forced to. Architectury API is not a requirement anymore.\n- This mod is now licensed under the LGPL-v3 license. I changed my mind about using MIT, and made a switch.\n- For privacy and legal resons that were not taken into account in v2.X, I have removed the feature that allows you to see other player's statistics without their consent. However, I did implement a feature allowing people to export and load statistics via files, so you can share your statistics in form of files instead.\n\n### Now onto the changes that were made and features that were implemented:\n- Minor changes to the GUI\n- Changed the Minecraft Wiki URL to point to 'minecraft.wiki'\n- Reworked the player badge system, allowing players to obtain the same badge multiole times (does not apply to BSS's badges yet however).\n- Added a \"Player badges\" statistics tab, allowing users to see all badges, including ones they don't have, so users can know what badges exist and are yet to be obtained.\n- Implemented an API. Now other mod developers can use the API to add their own custom statistics tabs and menu-bar items to the Better Statistics Screen. Note that you need to use the TCDCommons API for this as well. The API is the biggest reason I decided to work on v3.0, so others can integrate this mod into their mods as well.\n- Implemented a feature that allows you to save and load statistics files, allowing you to share your statistics with anyone over the internet. Note that the other person needs to install the same mods as the ones you have in order to see the modded stats that apply to you. If they don't install said mods, they won't be able to see those modded stats when opening them. Also note that opening a statistics file will not override your actual in-game statistics.\n- ModMenu and REI integrations are still present, allowing you to access the config through ModMenu and REI item screens by LMB/RMB-ing item stats. Those two mods are optional, and you do not have to install them.\n- Optionally install this mod on the server (not required) for the ability to receive live statistics updates so the Statistics HUD feature updates the pinned stats on the screen live.\n\n**Note:** As mentioned above, due to issues with how Fabric Loader itself behaves, this mod not only needs Fabric API present, but doesn't work with 1.20.2 at the moment. I will make attempts to port to 1.20.2 soon.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-02T07:53:27.547247Z","downloads":646,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a2d18df8d3004cde9d9ab8c8edee428465db94d09b6b567a824b215c3cbd6e96a231b11ff220bc04ca98efd8d12859f729e4c4156d8b5cddc37a76026b84ac1d","sha1":"17b8111404d89fce0ce6444a70ee810a3d821f57"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/versions/uxQfDyI7/betterstats-3.1%2Bfabric-1.20.1.jar","filename":"betterstats-3.1+fabric-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":553671,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Eldc1g37","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"6Y0z3ceK","user":{"id":"j0Ha6a2h","username":"TheCSDev","name":"TheCSDev","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66475965?v=4","bio":"Hello there random person.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-09-22T20:36:10.170755Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":191012,"followers":594,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"XGW2fviP","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.53 (Fabric 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-fabric","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1136579,"followers":2793,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**:<br/>**It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**:<br/>**It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**:<br/>**It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**:<br/>**It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Client sided library.** YACL is built for client mods only, making it a smaller size.\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2023-09-28T15:30:26.967460Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":739289,"followers":1345,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19.4-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","22w42a","23w05a","23w06a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"3hsIB5yP","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.1+1.20 (Fabric)","version_number":"3.2.1+1.20-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Changes\n\n### Config API\n\n- Added `ConfigClassHandler#save` and `ConfigClassHandler#load` and deprecated `ConfigClassHandler#serializer`.\n  - The serializer should now never be called directly.\n  - New load method tells serializer to load into a new instance of the config class.
